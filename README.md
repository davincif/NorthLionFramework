#### An arabic proverb
"Who plants dates do not harvest dates". In the old times, a dates tree takes over 80 years after planted to give its fruitage. Nowadays it has changed thanks to tecnologi, but not that time. One day, at the arid pastures of Arabia, a young man had found a old man planting dates trees. The young man asked:

-- Sir, why are you planting dates? you're never gonna eat them.

-- if everybody thinks like you, no one would had never eaten dates.

###### this project os a date tree ;D

# North Lion Framework - NLF
* NLF Goal: NLF is an attempt to forge a **cross-platform and easy-to-use Game Engine**, and when I say "cross-platform" I mean from Linuxs to Xbox, passing through Android.
* How can we do it? Using inbuilt third party source and Languages how can to it too. NLF uses SDL2, SDL_Image and LUA, and it's code entirely in C which is a very powerfull language.
* Up to now, what we've got? Ehhh... not much, sorry ^^". There's still not a beta or alpha version, but some modules' development are at full power.
	* About environment: for linux users you can pull the repository and run the INSTALL bash script, it will set up whats is need for you. I still wasn't able to set it up on windows, and I don't have a MAC machine to try it  ^^". But theorically, it shall be easy.
	* Also the INSTALL bash script shall work on debean based linuxs (already tested on ubuntu, mint and pingOS) and shall not work on red hat based linuxs, but it also shall not be very hard to do so.
* About project planing: look into the wiki, inside the documentation folder.
